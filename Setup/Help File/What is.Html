            <P><I>IP Traffic Spy</I>  is a utility that allows you to easily watch the data that
            is being passed back and forth from your computer and other computers on the internet
            or network. This is accomplished by reading the raw TCP/IP packets that are processed
            by your network adapter and displaying them in a user friendly fashion.</P>
