            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Main Dialog" or "Data Grid Dialog" is where TCP/IP packets will be displayed that were
            encountered but not filtered out by one or more of your <a href="Include Dialog.Html">Inclusion</a> or
            <a href="Exclude Dialog.Html">Exclusion</A> filters.

            <BR><BR><B>The data grid displays various columns:</B>
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Date</B> is the date that the packet was encountered.
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Time</B> is the time that the packet was encountered.
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>S-IP</B> is the originating IP of the TCP/IP packet.
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>D-IP</B> is the intended destination IP of the TCP/IP packet.
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>S-Port</B> is the port that the TCP/IP packed originated from.
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>D-Port</B> is the intended destination port.
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Text</B> This is the actual text data that was appended to the TCP/IP packet.
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Size</B> This is the overall size of the TCP/IP packet.

            <BR><BR><B>The data grid also displays various icons for each specific data direction:</B>
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<Img Src="Sent Packet.GIF"> <B>Sent Packets</B> are packets that were sent from your computer.
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<Img Src="Received Packet.GIF"> <B>Received Packets</B> are packets that were received by your computer.
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<Img Src="Foreign Packet.GIF"> <B>Foreign Packets</B> are packets that were encountered by your network
                    interface that are not destined for your computer. These are usually packets that are broadcast from various
                    broadcast protocols and data transmitted by older hubs (as opposed to switches).

            <BR><BR><B>Notes:</B>
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grid will only hold 100,000 lines of packet information. The oldest packets
            will be truncated from the grid as packets are received that overflows this limit.
