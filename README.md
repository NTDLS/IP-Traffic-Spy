# IP-Traffic-Spy
Allows you to easily watch the data that is being passed back and forth from your computer and other computers on the internet or network. This is accomplished by reading the raw TCP/IP packets that are processed by your network adapter and displaying them in a user friendly fashion.

Especially fun on older networks with HUBs (as opposed to switches) where data is frequently broadcast and essential when debugging intentional network broadcasting.
